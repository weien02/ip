# Qwerty User Guide

Welcome to Qwerty, the cheeky little task and loan manager thatâ€™ll help you keep track of everything on your todo list â€” from deadlines to events, and even loans (because we all know that *one* person who *always* forgets what they owe). It's easy to use, looks simple, but packs a punch when it comes to keeping you organised.

## How to Use Qwerty?

Once Qwertyâ€™s up and running, itâ€™s all about those nifty commands. Hereâ€™s the rundown:

### Commands

- **list**: See all your current tasks, laid out nice and simple.

  ```text
  list
  ```

- **todo {desc}**: Add a To-Do task. Just pop in a description of what you need to do. Itâ€™s as easy as pie!

  ```text
  todo Buy groceries
  ```

- **deadline {desc} /by {yyyy-MM-dd HHmm}**: Got a deadline? No worries, just add your task with a due date and time in this format: `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

  ```text
  deadline Finish homework /by 2025-02-20 1800
  ```

- **event {desc} /from {start} /to {end}**: Got an event coming up? Whether itâ€™s a meeting or a birthday party, add it here with the start and end times.

  ```text
  event Recess Week /from 22 February /to 2 March
  ```

- **loan {desc} /from {loaner} /to {loanee}**: Need to track a loan? Whether itâ€™s money, books, or a DVD thatâ€™s probably never coming back, add it here.

  ```text
  loan $1000 /from me /to Alice
  ```

- **find {desc}**: Searching for something? This will find all tasks with the description containing the word(s) youâ€™ve entered.

  ```text
  find homework
  ```

- **mark {index}**: Finished something? Mark it as done, and feel smug about it.

  ```text
  mark 1
  ```

- **unmark {index}**: Oh no, made a mistake? Unmark it and start again.

  ```text
  unmark 1
  ```

- **delete {index}**: If somethingâ€™s no longer needed, you can delete it with this command.

  ```text
  delete 3
  ```

- **bye**: Saying goodbye? Let Qwerty know youâ€™re off. It wonâ€™t be offended.

  ```text
  bye
  ```
